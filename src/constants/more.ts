  bio: "I'm someone who loves movies and TV shows. I enjoy racquet sports (tennis, table tennis, badminton, pickleball) and chess, + board/card games. I like exploring new experiences and picking up new hobbies (recently, I've been learning how to roller skate). \n\n\t Beyond my usual interests, I enjoy travel. Going abroad in Singapore was one of the best months of my life, where I immersed myself into an entirely different cultural perspective. I try to keep that same spirit of curiosity and openness in everything I do.",
