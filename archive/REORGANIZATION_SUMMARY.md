# Constants Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. File Organization
**Created New Organized Files:**
- ✅ `experiences.ts` - Centralized professional experiences and education
- ✅ `skills.ts` - All skills, hobbies, and styling helpers (techColors, complexityClasses)
- ✅ `projects.ts` - Clean projects data with accurate descriptions
- ✅ `index.ts` - Central export hub for all constants

**Moved to Archive:**
- ✅ `archive/blog-page.ts` - Blog content (route exists but not in nav)
- ✅ `archive/connect-page.ts` - Connect page (commented out, unused)
- ✅ `archive/lab.ts` - Creative zone content (route exists but not in nav)
- ✅ `archive/pages.ts` - Old monolithic file (replaced by experiences.ts and skills.ts)
- ✅ `archive/portfolio.ts` - Old portfolio file (replaced by projects.ts)

**Updated Existing Files:**
- ✅ `resume.ts` - Fixed PDF path to point to actual resume file
- ✅ `site.ts` - Updated description to reflect blockchain/Web3 focus
- ✅ `sections.ts` - Removed unused import

### 2. Content Accuracy Updates

**Resume Path:**
- Changed from placeholder URL to: `/Akhil Resume • Aug 2025.pdf`

**Site Description:**
- Updated to: "Graduate student at UIUC studying Computer Science. Building at the intersection of blockchain, Web3, and full-stack engineering."

**Projects Data:**
- Added proper technologies arrays for each project
- Added status field (In Development, Active, Completed)
- Improved descriptions for clarity
- All projects now accurately reflect work done:
  - WhatAGent (AI agent with CLI and voice capabilities)
  - OnChain Mafia (Solana dApp with ZK proofs)
  - GymBro (Multi-platform fitness app)
  - NUS Mods (University module planning)
  - Upland Chess (Blockchain chess game)

**Skills Organization:**
- Renamed "Tools" category to "Tools & Databases" for clarity
- Updated hobby category from "Sports/Hobbies" to "Sports & Recreation"
- Added Solana and Rust to techColors mapping

### 3. Import Updates

**Updated Route Files:**
- ✅ `src/routes/+page.svelte` - Updated to import from new organized files
- ✅ `src/routes/portfolio/+page.svelte` - Updated imports and added project mapping logic
- ✅ `src/routes/blog/+page.svelte` - Updated to import from archive
- ✅ `src/routes/creative-zone/+page.svelte` - Updated to import from archive

**Import Path Changes:**
```typescript
// Old
import { experiences } from "../constants/pages";
import { projectsData } from "../constants/portfolio";
import { skillsData } from "../constants/pages";

// New
import { experiences } from "../constants/experiences";
import { projectsData } from "../constants/projects";
import { skillsData } from "../constants/skills";

// Or use central index
import { experiences, projectsData, skillsData } from "../constants";
```

### 4. Documentation

**Created:**
- ✅ `src/constants/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation of constants structure
- ✅ This summary document

**README includes:**
- Directory structure overview
- Usage examples with recommended import patterns
- Organization principles
- Maintenance guidelines
- Content accuracy notes

## File Structure

### Before
```
src/constants/
├── blog-page.ts (unused)
├── connect-page.ts (unused)
├── fonts.ts
├── home.ts
├── labels.ts
├── lab.ts (unused)
├── links.ts
├── more.ts
├── nav.ts
├── pages.ts (monolithic, mixed concerns)
├── portfolio.ts (mixed showcase and project data)
├── resume.ts
├── sections.ts
├── site.ts
└── skills.ts
```

### After
```

├── README.md ⭐ NEW
├── index.ts ⭐ NEW (central exports)

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization** - Each file has a single, clear purpose
2. **Easier Navigation** - No more searching through large files
3. **Type Safety** - Maintained all TypeScript types and interfaces
4. **Clean Imports** - Can import from index or specific files
5. **Preserved History** - Old files archived, not deleted
6. **Accurate Content** - All data now matches resume
7. **Better Docs** - README explains structure and usage

## Verification

All changes verified with:
- ✅ TypeScript type checking (`npm run check`)
- ✅ Import resolution across all route files
- ✅ No runtime errors
- ✅ All active routes working

## Next Steps

Recommended future improvements:
1. Consider removing unused routes (blog, creative-zone) or fully implement them
2. Add demo URLs to projects where applicable
3. Add project images (currently using placeholder)
4. Consider creating a color scheme selector UI (colorSchemes.ts exists but not integrated)

## Notes

- All content now accurately reflects resume details including NUS study abroad
- Projects include proper technology stacks and status indicators
- Skills organized by category with proficiency levels
- Experiences listed in chronological order with detailed descriptions
